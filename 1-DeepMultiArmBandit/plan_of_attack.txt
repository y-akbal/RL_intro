1 - Set up an enviroment, this enviroment should be capable of batched inference
    a - Enviroment consist of say 1000 people with some weighted choices, we shall also be learning the ranking,
    b - The model will also learn the embeddings of these groups as well,
    c - Make the batch size as large as possible,
2 - Set up the buffer play, the buffer play shold be able to takes observations in and should be able to produce batches
3 - Set up the model, the model should be able to make recommendations, and should be able to the ranking automatically. 
4 - Do the training in torch. Follow gradient descent in the RL book.



TearLiq (Sequential recommendations)

Given the learning and the embeddings of the model, we do Sequential learning: 
    a - Model(person) -> sigmoid(mask) -> top_k -> Order -> Customer 
    b - Second model(person, mask) -> permutation -> Customer -> result?
    c - For this one you will need to implement the environment carefully, enviroment should allow you to do the stuff carefully.
